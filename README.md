- 👋 Hi, I’m @Budsy of BudsySoft Software (DBA), better known (maybe) as Bob Dickow!

- 👀 I’m interested in .NET C#, Forth, and PHP and Javascript, though I've worked in about 10 programming languages over the 
years (C, LISP, PERL, PROMAL, Java, etc). Lately I've been involved with long-term software development 
as lead programmer for EEtility Co. I have also been a team member working on the OC-Care app for Omnicell Inc. 
Otherwise I free-lance developer doing odds 'n ends, interventions, commissions and coffee break jobs on Upwork.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala. (say SKAH-la' as in 'La Scala' opera house).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I might have time for and an interest in.

- 📫 How to reach me? Try Robert Dickow on Facebook. You'll see a still life banner pic I made using Imagine ray-tracing software on an Amiga computer.
